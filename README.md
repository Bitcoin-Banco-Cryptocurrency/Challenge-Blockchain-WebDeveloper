## Challenge for Developer

A customer needs to receive, send, gettokens, check transaction also get balance from a contract (contract <a href="https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x9dee8bbfdd62dabf3dcb6e6e1fb1f6cd75ba9739#code">0x9dee8bbfdd62dabf3dcb6e6e1fb1f6cd75ba9739</a>).

Based on this you will need to develop:

- a simple API to perform all contract functions;
- it should be possible to search for transaction by their txid or balance (one or more);
- it must be possible to order the result by confirmations (asc and desc);

The test should be done in Node and we do like if you avoid frameworks. We expect at the end of the test, outside the API running, the following items:

- an explanation of what is needed to make your project work;
- an explanation of how to perform the tests;

Remember that at the time of the evaluation we will look at:

- Code organization;
- Object-Oriented Principles;
- Maintenance;
- Version control knowledge;
- Unit Test ( Plus );
- Design Pattern ( Plus );
